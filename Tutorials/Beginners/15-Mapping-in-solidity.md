# What's Mapping

Mapping in solidity can be understood as a dictionary of python, which stores a key-value pair. A key can be of a specific type (uint, address, bytes) and value can be of types such as Uint, Address, bytes, array, or mapping. <br>

There are few exception to key type which are, it can not be of type mapping, dynamic array, a contract, enum and struct.

## Declaring mapping in solidity
Here, `mapping` is keyword. Key is mapped to value using symbol `=>`, and lastly need to decide a name for this mapping `name_of_mapping`.

```solidity
// syntax
mapping (key => value) name_of_mapping ;

// example
mapping (address => uint) balances ;
```

`Note : ` The key data is not actually stored in a mapping, only its `keccak256` hash used to look up the value.


## Various possible key and value type

| Key Type      | Value Type                                             |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Uint**      | _Uint_ or _Address_ or _bytes_ or _array_ or _mapping_ |
| **address**   | _Uint_ or _Address_ or _bytes_ or _array_ or _mapping_ |
| **bytes**     | _Uint_ or _Address_ or _bytes_ or _array_ or _mapping_ |
| ~~mapping~~   |                 NA                                     |
| ~~dynamic array~~   |           NA                                     |
| ~~contract~~   |                NA                                     |
| ~~enum~~      |                 NA                                     |
| ~~struct~~    |                 NA                                     |


# Mapping examples
In the example given below, I have created a mapping with a name `Eth_users` which maps address to uint. Here address can be any arbitrary ethereum address and uint for storing amount. The first function `add_amnt` takes in two parameters, an address and amount to be added and it marked as external function with no return type. This [Function](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/10-Functions-in-solidity.md) adds the given amount to the given address.<br>

The second function `fetch_amnt` deals with fetching the amount available at a particular given address. This function only requires an address and it fetches the amount and returns it back.



```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;


contract map_demo {
    
    mapping (address => uint) Eth_users;

    function add_amnt(address _myadd, uint _amnt) external {
        Eth_users[_myadd] = _amnt;
    }

    function fetch_amnt(address _myadd) public view returns (uint){
        return Eth_users[_myadd];
    }
}

```


# Key point to remember for a mapping in solidity
- Hashtable storing keys and corresponding value
- keyType can be value types such as uint, address or bytes
- valueType can be any type including another mapping or an array
- Maapings are not iterable
- Mappings do not have a length
- Mappings can be of nested type as well (meaning one mapping inside other)
- Mapping can only be used for state variables (a storage refernce type)
