# Operators in Solidity
Operators in any programming language provide symbols to perform various mathematical operations.Each operator has it's symbol and it always performs a specific operation.These operands should have the same [data type](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/2-Data_types_solidity.md) otherwise, the operation on given operands would result in **error**; if data type of both the operand as not THE same. Like any other programming language, solidity also supports all the standard operators (except a few like _Floor divison_ `//`).

In general, an operator always act between two operands and output some value. As always, few exceptions are:<br>
> _logical NOT_ `~` and _bitwise NOT_ `!` , requires only one operand.

There are predominantly **Five** major categories of Opeartors, which are
- Arithmetic Operator
- Logical Operator
- Comparison Operator
- Bitwise Operator
- Assignment Operator

# Arithmetic Operator
**Applicable on `integer` type operands**<br>
Let's consider variables x,y,p,q (declared below - having different data type)
```solidity
uint x = 10;
uint y = 20;
int p  = -5;
int q  = 11;
```

## Addition: `+`
To facilitate addition of two numbers (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint sum = x + y; // sum = 30
int sum1 = p + q; // sum1 = 6
```
## Subtraction : `-`
To facilitate subtraction of two numbers (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint sub1 = x - y;  // Error during compiling, as result would be of int type (-10)
uint sub1 = y - x;  // sub1 = 10
int sub2 = p - q;   // sub2 = -16
```
## Unary Subtraction (only for signed integer) : `-`
Applicable only on signed integer type : int
```solidity
int Un = - q;  // Un = -11
```
## Multiplication: `*`
To facilitate multiplication between two numbers (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint mul_1 = x * y; // mul_1 = 200
int mul_2 = p * q;   // mul_2 = -55
```
## Divison : `/`
To facilitate divison between two numbers (both operands should be either uint `OR` int) and result is exactly as floor divison
```solidity
uint div_1 = x / y;      // div_1 = 0
int div_2  = p / q;      // div_2 = 0
uint div_3 = (x+1) / 4;  // div_3 = 2
```

## Modulo (Modulus): `%`
Modulo operation outputs the remainder (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint mod_1 = x % y;  // mod_1 = 10
int mod_2  = p % q;  // mod_2 = -5
```
## Exponential : ` ** `
This is equivalent to raise to the power (or exponent): (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint exp_1 = x ** y;  // exp_1 = 100000000000000000000
```

# Logical Operator
**Applicable on `Boolean` type operands**
## Logical AND : `&&`

## Logical OR  : `||`

## Logical NOT : `!`


# Comparison Operator
**Applicable on `integer` type operands**

## Less than : `<`

## Less than or equal to : `<=`

## Greater than : `>`

## Greater than or equal to: `>=`

## Is equal to (equality) : `==`

## Not equal to (inequality) : `!=`

# Bit Operator (or Bitwise)
**Applicable on `bit represented` type operands**

## Bitwise AND : `&`

## Bitwise OR  : `|`

## Bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) : `^`

## Bitwise NOT (negation): `~`

## Shift Right : `>>`

## Shift Left : `<<`

# Assignment Operator

## Equals Operator : `=`

## Increment & assign : `+=`

## Decrement & assign : `-=`



# Check for `*=` and `/=`
