# Operators in Solidity
Operators in any programming language provide symbols to perform various mathematical operations.Each operator has it's symbol and it always performs a specific operation.These operands should have the same [data type](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/2-Data_types_solidity.md) otherwise, the operation on given operands would result in **error**; if data type of both the operand as not THE same. Like any other programming language, solidity also supports all the standard operators (except a few like _Floor divison_ `//`).

In general, an operator always act between two operands and output some value. As always, few exceptions are:<br>
> _logical NOT_ `~` and _bitwise NOT_ `!` , requires only one operand.

There are predominantly **Five** major categories of Opeartors, which are
- Arithmetic Operator
- Logical Operator
- Comparison Operator
- Bitwise Operator
- Assignment Operator

# Arithmetic Operator
Get all codes (compiler ready) at one place [GitHub Gist - Arithmetic Operators](https://gist.github.com/raj-pranav/000be584c93771d2fccbced55de29313)

**Applicable on `integer` type operands**<br>
Let's consider variables x,y,p,q (declared below - having different data type)
```solidity
uint x = 10;
uint y = 20;
int p  = -5;
int q  = 11;
```

## Addition: `+`
To facilitate addition of two numbers (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint sum = x + y; // sum = 30
int sum1 = p + q; // sum1 = 6
```
## Subtraction : `-`
To facilitate subtraction of two numbers (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint sub1 = x - y;  // Error during compiling, as result would be of int type (-10)
uint sub1 = y - x;  // sub1 = 10
int sub2 = p - q;   // sub2 = -16
```
## Unary Subtraction (only for signed integer) : `-`
Applicable only on signed integer type : int
```solidity
int Un = - q;  // Un = -11
```
## Multiplication: `*`
To facilitate multiplication between two numbers (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint mul_1 = x * y; // mul_1 = 200
int mul_2 = p * q;   // mul_2 = -55
```
## Divison : `/`
To facilitate divison between two numbers (both operands should be either uint `OR` int) and result is exactly as floor divison
```solidity
uint div_1 = x / y;      // div_1 = 0
int div_2  = p / q;      // div_2 = 0
uint div_3 = (x+1) / 4;  // div_3 = 2
```

## Modulo (Modulus): `%`
Modulo operation outputs the remainder (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint mod_1 = x % y;  // mod_1 = 10
int mod_2  = p % q;  // mod_2 = -5
```
## Exponential : ` ** `
This is equivalent to raise to the power (or exponent): (both operands should be either uint `OR` int)
```solidity
uint exp_1 = x ** y;  // exp_1 = 100000000000000000000
```

# Logical Operator

Get all codes (compiler ready) at one place [GitHub Gist - Logical Operators](https://gist.github.com/raj-pranav/ef6eb6ab9628b6f6731257e72531d6b8)

**Applicable on `Boolean` type operands**

Let's consider the following variable (for simplicity we have used uint type only)

```solidity
uint x = 10;
uint y = 20;

bool a = x > y ; // a is false
bool b = x < y;  // b is true
```

## Logical AND : `&&`

The result of logical AND will be true if both are true, otherwise false (even if any one of them is false)

**Logical AND Truth Table**
| Value1 | Value2 | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| True   | True   | True   |
| True   | False  | False  |
| False  | True   | False  |
| False  | False  | False  |

```solidity
bool test1 = a && b;        // false && true -> false
bool test2 = a && false;    // false && false -> false
bool test3 = true && b;     // true && true -> true
bool test4 = true && false; // true && false -> false
```
## Logical OR  : `||`
The result of logical OR will be true if either of them is true, otherwise false (if both are false)

**Logical OR Truth Table**
| Value1 | Value2 | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| True   | True   | True   |
| True   | False  | True   |
| False  | True   | True   |
| False  | False  | False  |

```solidity
bool test5 = a || b;        // false && true -> true
bool test6 = a || false;    // false && false -> false
bool test7 = true || b;     // true && true -> true
bool test8 = true ||false;  // true && false -> true
```
## Logical NOT : `!`
It changes the result to opposite: makes a true to false and vice versa

```solidity
bool test9 = !a;   // test9 will be true
bool test10 = !b;  // test10 will be false
```

# Comparison Operator
Get all codes (compiler ready) at one place [GitHub Gist - Comparison Operators](https://gist.github.com/raj-pranav/60184468833969964fae355dab9369b7)

**Applicable on `integer` type operands** and result will be `boolean` ; both operands should be of same data type, either int or uint.

Comparison operator compares the value of two integer operands and produce a boolean result (true/false). Let's declare a few variable to test all comparison operators.
```solidity

uint x = 10;
uint y = 12;

```
## Less than : `<`
Checks whether, left side operand is less than the right side operand; returns true if correct otherwise false.
```solidity
bool res = x < y;   // res = true

```
## Less than or equal to : `<=`
Checks whether, left side operand is less than or atleast equal to the right side operand; returns true if correct otherwise false.
```solidity
bool res1 = x <= y;    // res1 = true
bool s_res1 = x <= 10; // s_res1 = true
```
## Greater than : `>`
Checks whether, left side operand is greater than the right side operand; returns true if correct otherwise false.
```solidity
bool res2 = x > y;  // res2 = false

```

## Greater than or equal to: `>=`
Checks whether, left side operand is greater than or atleast equal to the right side operand; returns true if correct otherwise false.
```solidity
bool res3 = x >= y;    // res3 = false
bool s_res3 = x >= 10; // s_res3 = true
```

## Is equal to (equality) : `==`
Also known as `Double equal to` and it is completely different from `=`. It compare both operands and return true if both the same, false otherwise.<br>
`Note` : Data type of both the inetgers should be same (irrespective of the value). For example

```solidity
uint p = 10;
int q = 10;
bool p_q = p == q  // This expression will throw compilation error, as data types are different.
```

Taking our original declared variable,
```solidity
bool res4 = x == y; // res4 = false

```

## Not equal to (inequality) : `!=`
It compare both operands and return true if both the NOT equal, false otherwise
```solidity
bool res5 = x != y; // res5 = true

```

# Bit Operator (or Bitwise)
**Applicable on `bit represented` type operands**

## Bitwise AND : `&`

## Bitwise OR  : `|`

## Bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) : `^`

## Bitwise NOT (negation): `~`

## Shift Right : `>>`

## Shift Left : `<<`


# Assignment Operator

## Equals Operator : `=`


# Special : Increment & Decrement Operators
Although, this is part of `Arithmetic Operators` as it is applied on integers and also outputs an integer, but still I am keeping it separate (just for simplicity)

## Increment Operator (++)

## Decrement Operator (--)
