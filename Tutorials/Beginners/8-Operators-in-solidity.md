# Operators in Solidity
Operators in any programming language provide symbols to perform various mathematical operations.Each operator has it's symbol and it always performs a specific operation. Like any other programming language, solidity also supports all the standard operators (except a few like _Floor divison_ `//`).

In general, an operator always act between two operands and output some value. As always, few exceptions are:<br>
> _logical NOT_ `~` and _bitwise NOT_ `!` , requires only one operand.

There are predominantly **Five** major categories of Opeartors, which are
- Arithmetic Operator
- Logical Operator
- Comparison Operator
- Bitwise Operator
- Assignment Operator

# Arithmetic Operator
**Applicable on `integer` type operands**
Let's consider variables x,y,p,q (declared below - having different data type)
```solidity
uint x = 10;
uint y = 20;
int p  = -5;
int q  = 11;
```

## Addition: `+`
To facilitate addition of two numbers (both uint `OR` both int)
```solidity
uint sum = x + y;
int sum1 = p + q;
```
## Subtraction : `-`
To facilitate subtraction of two numbers (int/uint)
```solidity
x - y
x - z 
```
## Unary Subtraction (only for signed integer) : `-`
Applicable on only one signed integer type : int
```solidity
- (z)
```
## Multiplication: `*`
To facilitate multiplication between two numbers (int/uint)
```solidity
x * y
x * z 
```
## Division : `/`

## Modulo (Modulus): `%`

## Exponential : ` ** `

# Logical Operator
**Applicable on `Boolean` type operands**
## Logical AND : `&&`

## Logical OR  : `||`

## Logical NOT : `!`


# Comparison Operator
**Applicable on `integer` type operands**

## Less than : `<`

## Less than or equal to : `<=`

## Greater than : `>`

## Greater than or equal to: `>=`

## Is equal to (equality) : `==`

## Not equal to (inequality) : `!=`

# Bit Operator (or Bitwise)
**Applicable on `bit represented` type operands**

## Bitwise AND : `&`

## Bitwise OR  : `|`

## Bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) : `^`

## Bitwise NOT (negation): `~`

## Shift Right : `>>`

## Shift Left : `<<`

# Assignment Operator

## Equals Operator : `=`

## Increment & assign : `+=`

## Decrement & assign : `-=`



# Check for `*=` and `/=`
