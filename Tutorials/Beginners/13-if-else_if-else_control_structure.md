# If - else if - else in solidity
If, else if, else - all together is one of the control structures available in solidity. A control structure is essentially a technique to control the execution flow of code, based on the given condition (that's why it is also referred as _conditional statement_). This structure simply evalulate condition at each stage and accordingly executes the block of code. The working principle of `if-else if-else` is similiar to any other programming language.

Sample structure of the **if - else if - else**

```solidity
if (condition) {
  body ;}
else if (another condition) {
  body ; }
else {
  body ; }
```

Let's break them all and get to know how they work in various scenarios

## If condition only
` If ` condition block is used in situations, where you are only concerned about evaluating a particular condition to true, and return some result BUT never bothered; what if that condition evaluates to false. You will only need one if statement, in such situation.

In the given example code, the [state variable](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/3-State_variable_solidity.md) is initialized with 10 and a [function](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/10-Functions-in-solidity.md) exists which compares the supplied value `_x` with that of `x`, if the supplied value is greater of equal to x then return true otherwise 'nothing has been defined explicity for else part.



```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract demo_if {
    uint x = 10;
    function Compare (uint _x) external view returns (bool){
        if (_x >= x) {    // only one if statement
            return true;
        }
    }
}    
    
```

`Note :` Solidity will take care of the else part, even though you have not explicitly mentioned it and it will simply return false (as seen in above example).<br>
return type `boolean` -> else will return false
return type `uint`    -> else will return 0
and so on..


## If and else condition
In the above example, the else part is not defined. We can define the else part to explicity handles a specific return value (instead solidity returns a default value). Look at the example code below to understand how it can be done.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract demo_if {
    uint x = 10;
    function Compare (uint _x) external view returns (string memory){
        if (_x >= x) {   // if section
            return 'Given value is greater or equal to x';}
        else {          // else section
            return 'Given value is less than x';
        }
    }
}    
    
```
`Notice :` that, we have changed the return [data type](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/2-Data_types_solidity.md) in this ðŸ‘† function (peviously it was `bool` , now it is `string`. Since string requires memory that's why it postfixed with the data type.


## If, else if , and else - all three together
Now, there could be a situation where you want to extensively divide you criteria into multiple blocks and based on the evaluation you return the result. Let's look at the code below to evaluate the given number individually to  `less than` , `equal to` or `greater than`.


```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract demo_if {

    uint x;

    function CompNum (uint _x) public view returns (string memory) {
        if (_x > x) {
            return 'The number entered is bigger';
        } else if (_x < x) {
            return 'Number entered is lesser';
        } else {
            return 'Both numbers are equal';
        }
        
    }
}
```
