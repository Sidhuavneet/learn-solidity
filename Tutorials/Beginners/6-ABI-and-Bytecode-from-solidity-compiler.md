When you compile a [Smart Contract](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/4-what-is-a-Smart_contract.md) in online [Remix IDE](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/5-Getting-familiar-with-Remix-IDE.md), you will get two files as output and they are
- `ABI` : Application Binary Interface
- `Bytecode` : Machine level code which gets executed by EVM

In this section, you will learn about these two file, how they look and how they are used

# ABI
ABI (`Application Binary Interface`) of a smart contract is the standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interaction within the ecosystem. Whenever a smart contract gets deployed, the bytecode of the corresponding contract is stored on the blockchain having a specific address (each smart contract have their own address). At this time, the solidity code is converted into bytecode (very hard for humans for read but machine love this code - a sequence of bytecode) and being executed by all EVMs in peer-to-peer network. In order to access any function of this contract, from a higher level programming language, users need to translate function/variable names and arguments into byte representations for bytecode to work (this is called encoding).

Upon receiving the data sent back from the EVM, which is again a bytecode, the high level program should decode the bytecode into human readable values. ABI comes into picture, it contains the name and types associated with all opeartions, which helps to encode and decode the data in/out of the contract. 

If a third party tool/service from outside the blockchain, is able interact with the smart contracts ; it's only because of ABI.

`In very simple way`: In Ethereum, ABI is basically how you can encode Solidity contract calls for the EVM and, backwards, how to read the data out of transactions.

## A sample Solidity smart contract

We will use this code to show the ABI and bytecode generated by the compiler, for this smart contract.
More information about [state variable](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/3-State_variable_solidity.md)

```solidity

//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DemoABI {
  string user = "EtherBoy";
  uint8 public age = 30;
  
  function getUserName() public view returns (string memory) {
    return user;
  }
}

```

ABI for this code looks like below, the information is in `JSON` format. It provides pretty much everything related to variables/function such as name, type, visibility etc..

```json
[
	{
		"inputs": [],
		"name": "age",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "uint8",
				"name": "",
				"type": "uint8"
			}
		],
		"stateMutability": "view",
		"type": "function"
	},
	{
		"inputs": [],
		"name": "getUserName",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "string",
				"name": "",
				"type": "string"
			}
		],
		"stateMutability": "view",
		"type": "function"
	}
]
```
