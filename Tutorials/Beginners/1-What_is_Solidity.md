# Welcome to Solidity Programming language
Solidity is a programming language to write code for Ethereum based blockchain applications. The code is popularly known as `smart-contract` and the application is referred as `Dapps` or *Decentralized Apps*.

# About
Solidity is `High Level`, `Statically typed`, `Object-oriented` programming language inspired from *C++, JavaScript and Python*. It's one of the recently developed programming languages,which is in it's nascent stage (as of Jan, 2022) having current version as 0.8.11. You can always check the latest version [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases).
You can use solidity to write smart contracts (which is simply a code written in solidity) for `Ethereum` blockchain or any other compatible blockchains such as `Binance Smart Chain` (BSC), `Ethereum Classic`, `Tron`, `Avalanche`, `Polygon` and few others.

# Properties of Solidity language
- [x] Turing complete : It can theoretically complete any task that is given to it.
- [x] Object oriented : supports inheritance
- [x] Statically typed : Data type has to be assigned during the declaration
- [x] Curly-bracket language - similar to JavaScript, TypeScript etc..
- [x] Supports Native [Data types](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/2-Data_types_solidity.md) as well complex user defined data types

# Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Solidity
- [x] Remix : Official online IDE
- [x] Brownie : Python based dev framework 
- [x] Truffle : Ethereum development framework based on JavaScript
- [x] Hardhat : Ethereum development environment with local Ethereum network

# How it works
Step 1: You write a smart contract
Step 2: Compile it
  - The compiler will generate three files
    - Contract Metadata : JSON file having info such as input, output, data types, compiler version and so on.., of the contract
    - Bytecode : Hexadecimal data with opcode, which gets deployed on the `EVM` (Ethereum Virtual Machine) -> EVM powers the Ethereum blockchain
    - ABI : Application Binary Interface, helps to interact with another contracts on the blockchain as well as from outside the blockchain.
Step 3: Deploy the Bytecode & ABI, on a Target blockchain (Real - Mainnet/Testnet or Simulated environment such as browser)
  - ABI stays in the EVM while Bytecode gets deployed at the blockchain. This ABI helps to interact with the bytecode.

# Applications
- [x] Self executing contracts - Smart contracts
- [x] NFT : Non Fungible Token
- [x] Cryptocurrency : Fungible Token
- [x] Dapps : Decentralized applications
- [x] DeFi : Decentralized finance
- [x] Tokens : To share, exchange, stake
