`FunFact`: Remix doesn't mean to mixing/modifiying a song only, It is also an IDE to write [smart contract](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/4-what-is-a-Smart_contract.md) on Ethereum (Ethereum based blockchain) :smiley:

# What is an IDE & why it exists ?
`IDE` stands for **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironemnt. Any IDE is basically a collection of tools to write, test, and debug a code. An IDE can be generic (supports many programming language) or it can be specific.
Even without using an IDE, you could write the code and test it _BUT_ here are few advantages that comes along with an IDE
- You get a Text editor (code editor) to write your program : Integrated in the same environment
- A debugger : to save your from nightmares of what's breaking your code
- A compiler : Inherited from OS or inbuilt sometime : to provide you the machine code

a few examples : `VS Code`, `Jupyter Lab`, `PyCharm`, `Remix`, `Anaconda` .. and many others

I hope you got an !dea of an IDE.

# Remix IDE
- Remix is a powerful open source IDE that allows you to write smart contracts in [Solidity](https://github.com/raj-pranav/learn-solidity/blob/main/Tutorials/Beginners/2-Data_types_solidity.md) programming langauge.
- Remix is used for smart contract development as well as acts as a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.
- Remix IDE has modules for testing, debugging and deploying of smart contracts and much more.

Remix IDE is available both online (as a web-app in the browser) as well as offilne (standard installation for all major OS)

## Online Remix IDE
You can directly access online IDE from https://remix.ethereum.org/ , without the need of login. This Web-app version is most popular and widely used Remix IDE. In the subsequent sections, you will learn various components of online version of Remix and get started with it.
