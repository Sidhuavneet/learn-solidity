# What is an Event ?
Events are way to inform the external world (outside a blockchain) that something specific has happened along with the data value. The external applications (such as web-app or mobile app, or even desktop app) can subscribe to an event (or multiple events) and keep on listening them, whenever they occur. Events are the best to propagate message from blockchain to internet and `transaction log` stores the event data inside EVM. Further, the event data is not accessible from within the contracts. Transaction Logs are not part of the actual blockchain since they are not required for consensus.

These logs are associated with the address of the contract, are incorporated into the blockchain, and stay there as long as a block is accessible.

Events are inheritable members of the a contract, which means when you inherit a contract, along with external,internal & public function their events can also be accessed.

# How to create an event in solidity ?
`Event : ` are struct type, so it can have any data type.<br>
It is fairly straight forward to create event in solidity - using event keyword followed by a name (decided by user) and inside the body certain parameters, as shown in the code

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract Event_sample {

    event HighValueTx(    // creating an event
      address _from,
      address _to,
      uint amount,
      uint timeStamp  
    );

}
```

# Triggering an event (aka emit)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract Event_sample {
    event HighValueTx(
      address _from,
      address _to,
      uint amount,
      uint timeStamp  
    );

    function DetectHighVal(uint amount, address _to) external {
        if (amount > 100*10*18) { // 100 ETH -> this is represented in wei
            emit HighValueTx(msg.sender, _to, amount, block.timestamp );  // emitting sn event
            }
    }

}
```

# Relevance of Indexed item(s) in event
An attribute called `indexed`can be placed in between the data type and parameter name of an event, as shown below,

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract Event_sample {
    event HighValueTx(
      address indexed _from,    // _from parameter is indexed
      address _to,
      uint indexed amount,     // amount parameter is indexed
      uint timeStamp  
    );
```

When an `indexed` keyword is attached to a parameter, it is added to a special data structure called `topics` and the remaining parameters (without indexed) are stored in ABI-encoded data part of the log. The indexed type of parameters are easy to query using their names. Topics allow you to search for events, for example when filtering a sequence of blocks for certain events. You can also filter events by the address of the contract that emitted the event.

There is a maximum limit on indexing the number of parameters, which is `3`. You can apply indexed attributes to a maximum of three parameters.
