In 1994, Nick Szabo, coined the term <b>Smart Contract</b> or *self executing contract* that deal with exchnage of money/asset between two unknown parties. Prior to the term *Smart contract*, it used to be normally called as **code** or *computer program*. The reason for calling this special code as smart contract is,
- It runs on the blockchain (which is decentralized: powered by several node participating in a p2p network)
- Code executes financial transaction upon fulfillment of certain conditions
- Two parties, involved in the contract, does not need to know each other.

# What is a Smart Contract?
A **smart contract** is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain (can be other blockchain as well ..). It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Like a normal user's address, the Smart-Contract also have a valid & fixed address in the ecosystem, which means it can sent money (ETH : Ether) to any other contract or user as well as can receive money from other contracts as well as any user.<br><br>
Smart contracts help you exchange money, property(both digital & physical), shares, or anything of value in a transparent, conflict-free way without the involvement of any other third parties. Smart contract are self executing in nature, does not require any one to take action and at the same time no can modify it; **Literally No one!** - not even the creator of that smart contract.<br><br>
The immutable nature of the smart contract has its own pros and cons. If there are any vulnerabilities in the code that will not be less than a nightmare and may incurr a loss of asset. On the pros side, if two parties agree upon the terms and conditions then they both/all have to abide by the rules and can not quit or disagree.<br><br>
You will see some examples in the example section below.

# Salient features of a Smart Contract (aka Self executing contracts)
- [x] Code running on a Blockchain
- [x] Smart contract are Immutable (after deployment) 
- [x] Has a specific address (account address)
- [x] Able to send/receive native token/currency
- [x] User can interact with the functions from outside blockchain
- [x] It is Permissionless: anyone can write smart contract and deploy it on blockchain
- [x] Two smart contracts can also interact with each other
- [x] Restriction on size limit : Max 24 KB (KiloBytes)
- [x] Transaction to/from smart contracts are open, transparent and traceable
